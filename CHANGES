* Handle descr, url and files in the rewriting
* Minor fix

2.0.0:
* Switch default branch from 2.0.0 to master

2.0.0~beta:
* Now based on opam 2 libs and intended for publications in the 2.0 format
  (inclusive opam files, etc.)
* Bumped version number to avoid confusion with opam versions
* Removed the two-step operation ("prepare" and "publish"). A single invocation
  does all
* Removed looking up current opam pinnings and repositories for metadata, which
  was too complex and counter-intuitive. Now opam files are looked up only in
  the specified directories or archives
* Multiple publications without added complexity
* Simplified command-line: URLs, directories, opam files, package names can be
  specified directly on the command-line, and repeated for multiple
  publications
* Allow providing the auth token directly
